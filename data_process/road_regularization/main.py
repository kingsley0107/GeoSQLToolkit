        mode : 'divided': split highway and non-highway when process the data while 'mixed' means mix them and process in one time.
        smooth_level (int, optional): The higher the smoother. The value that controls the level of simplification and smoothing of the road, the essence is the distance of the buffer that will be extracted centerlines. Defaults to 30.
